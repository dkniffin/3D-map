1. Get a JSON copy of OSM data
2. Organize the code and start forming into an API
3. Start rendering objects on top of the terrain
  - Start with roads and other paths
  - Surfaces (or a surface hybrid; ie: parks default to grass, etc)
  - Water (maybe in time to add animated texture)
  - Buildings
  - Trees
